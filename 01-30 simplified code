          After 7 years in Seattle, I have found myself enjoying happy hour beers, post-bike ride rewards, late night
          cocktails and more, all around the city. Below is a guide with some of the most notable places I have
          frequented over the years.
          <br> <br> Green pins are places I would recommend to a friend, while red pins are places I think you should
          avoid. A yellow pin means decide for yourself <br>
